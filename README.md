# NLP-machine-learning-project
Making an Email's context recognition software (similar to Gmail's spam and promotion classification),
using NLP (Natural Language Processing) techniques and several Machine Learning models and optimization algorithms. 

Models used:
- Doc2Vec (Document to vector) - Data preperation
- LSTM (long-short-term-memory) - Neural Network
- MLP (multi-layer-perceptron) - Neural Network
- LGBM (light gradient boosting model) - decision tree

Optimization Algorhitms used:
- Genetic Algorithm 
- Grid Search
- Bayesian optimization
